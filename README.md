Coding Challenge: NYC Schools

## **Requirements**:

Create a browser based or native app to provide information on NYC High schools. - **I have built a Native App to fulfill the requirements.**

1. Display a list of NYC High Schools. - **Completed**
	* Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2 

2. Selecting a school should show additional information about the school - **Completed**
	* Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing. 1. SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4 

## Libraries Used
I have implemented the app using iOS SDK native libraries without using any other open source libraries through cocoa pods to make sure the solution is minimalistic for the purpose of proving my technical cognizance for the data request.
*Just to let you know I am capable of integrating custom libraries in the real-world applications using Alamofire or libraries:)*


## UX Implementations

- Natural scrolling functionality with lazy loading (Infinite scrolling) to help reduce network traffic and latency and provide faster rendering time
- Searching of Schools to easily get the results wihtout needing to scroll through all the code
- Did a review of NYC Open Data and identified Search, Filter, Pagination capabilities and implemented in the app.
- Did the Network Error handling


## Bonus Sections

* Unit Tests - Currently in Progress
  Started API End Point testing
  Integrated Reachability open source library for network monitoring have to work on that

## Thank you for the opportunity, I hope I will be the right fit for the open position. Looking forward to meet the team in person! ***- Nethrah Ayyaswami***
